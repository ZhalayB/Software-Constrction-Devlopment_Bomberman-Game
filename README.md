3.1	: ELICITATION
In this step we will have a discussion with our team or the clients which want this game, the discussion include some main points which are based on:
▪	Communication Skills.
▪	Brainstorming.
3.1.1	COMMUNICATION SKILLS
We will involve a rich communication activity that entails our customer or team to interact and communicate their needs with us. Our analysts who have good communication skills on the other hand should have the capacity to grasp our game domain knowledge, Because Misunderstandings and communication gaps between two groups can cause negative consequences to software project.
3.1.2	BRAINSTORMING

Our team will do a brief group discussion and can share their ideas with our domain experts, Software experts as well, because multiple ideas, collect requirements and information can give us more knowledge with tremendous techniques. 
3.2	: EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIRMENTS
3.2.1	: USER INTERFACE
The user interface in the Bomberman game video game is to carry out the task with in the game. All the game rules will be followed. In this a user have to destroy all crates through the red colored big ball, the bomb and we just place the bomb with the crate which we have to break to complete level. All the guidance of Moving a player is mentioned which is that we have to use arrow keys to move Player (Bomberman) and to drop the bomb with space key.
3.2.2	: HARDWARE INTERFACE
The hardware modules in our project Bomberman game are not very large in number because we implemented our project by coding in java. The hardware interface are like the controller interfaces. Only Desktop is used to play his Game. We just use computer screen and mouse. Using keyboard we can play this game. Additionally, we have to use key board arrow keys and space key. 
3.2.3	: SOFTWARE INTERFACE
Software interfaces are just used to support graphics for our game code because software is the main driver for our game code. The software that we used for coding our Bomberman game is Eclipse with the JDK version 3.0.2. There was a proper class of the bomb and also defined its size in which it is clearly mentioned when to start up the bomb, when to explode it, radius and no of players can play. We used other classes like power up, enemy, player, floor, etc. we imported libraries of javax.swing.*, java.awt.* to make the frame or the interface of our game.
3.2.4	: COMMUNICATION INTERFACE
As our Bomberman game is only single player game at a time only one player can play it. We just developed it using java coding so there is no such communicating interface neither with the players nor with the enemies there. This game does not require internet connectivity. This is the kind of online game can be downloaded.
